# ⚛️ React Playground

Welcome to my curated collection of **React mini-projects** — built to sharpen my skills and explore real-world concepts in React.  
This repository is part of my larger 3-year mission to become a top 1% fullstack developer. Currently, I’m focused on the React ecosystem: building, experimenting, and deploying daily.
